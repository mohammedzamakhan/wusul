## What is an Access Pass?

An **Access Pass** is a digital credential issued to individuals (employees, guests, students, etc.) that allows them to access physical locations using their mobile device. Access passes are stored in Apple Wallet or Google Wallet and use NFC technology to communicate with access control readers.

## Operations

### Issue an Access Pass

Create a new access pass and send installation instructions to the user:

```javascript
const accessPass = await client.accessPasses.create({
  card_template_id: '0xt3mp14t3',
  full_name: 'Ahmed Al-Mansouri',
  email: 'ahmed@company.com',
  employee_id: 'EMP-001',
  site_code: '123',
  card_number: '45678',
  start_date: '2025-01-01T00:00:00Z',
  expiration_date: '2025-12-31T23:59:59Z',
  classification: 'full_time',
  title: 'Senior Engineer'
});
```

### Update an Access Pass

Modify information on an existing access pass. Updates are pushed to the user's device automatically:

```javascript
await client.accessPasses.update('0xp4551d', {
  title: 'Lead Engineer',
  expiration_date: '2026-12-31T23:59:59Z'
});
```

### Suspend an Access Pass

Temporarily disable access without deleting the pass:

```javascript
await client.accessPasses.suspend('0xp4551d');
```

### Resume an Access Pass

Re-enable a previously suspended pass:

```javascript
await client.accessPasses.resume('0xp4551d');
```

### Delete an Access Pass

Permanently remove an access pass:

```javascript
await client.accessPasses.delete('0xp4551d');
```
